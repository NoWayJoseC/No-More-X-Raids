No More Siege Raids! Part of the most self-explanatory mod series on the market. Now updated for Version 1.3.3200

Sieges have ruined so many of my overconfident, overacheiving colonies. Have you ever had your favorite pawn's heart destroyed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time? I have. 

Want to turn off siege raids? This mod is for you.  

This is an eco-friendly xpath patch. Load after any storyteller/raidstrategy-related mods for maximum compatability.
