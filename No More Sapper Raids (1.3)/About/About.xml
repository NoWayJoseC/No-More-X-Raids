No More Sapper Raids! Part of the most self-explanatory mod series on the market. Now updated for Version 1.3.3200

Building up thoughtful welcome mats for raiders is one of the small pleasures of the Rimworld. I personally don't like it when they decide to tear down the backdoor and blow up my dogs instead.

Want to turn off sapper raids? This mod is for you.  

This is an eco-friendly xpath patch. Load after any storyteller/raidstrategy-related mods for maximum compatability.
