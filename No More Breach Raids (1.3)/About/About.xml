No More Breach Raids! Part of the most self-explanatory mod series on the market. Now updated for Version 1.3.3200

Plasteel walls or not, breach raids suck if you're not well armed. Twice as much if you're in a mountain. Three times as much if you hate mechanoids.

Want to turn breach raids off? This mod is for you.

This is an eco-friendly xpath patch. Load after any storyteller/raidstrategy-related mods for maximum compatability.
